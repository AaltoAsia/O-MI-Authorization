      summary: "Add a new consumer"
      description: |
        Consumer consist of an identifier, which called `username` in the code.
        After adding, the consumer can be added to groups.

        **Note:** The consumer is automatically added to a group named
        `${username}_USERGROUP` and to the group `DEFAULT`.

        Creates a new empty group/role.
        A group can be connected to multiple consumers with
        [join-groups](#operation--join-groups-post).  This system does not
        impose any particular way of how to use groups. They can be thought as
        roles instead. To understand how the permissions combine when belonging
        to many groups, see
        [get-permissions](#operation--get-permissions-post).

      description: |
        Set permission permissions for a group/role. These are seperated in allow and
        deny permissions. In O-MI Node the permissions are prosessed by first filtering the
        incoming request by allow permissions and then filtering with the deny permissions from
        the result.

        To set permissions for consumer, it either needs to be added to groups or the
        automatic `username_USERGROUP` can be used.

      summary: "Get permissions of a consumer and a request type"
      description: |
        Permissions of a consumer for a request type. This operation should be
        used by O-MI Node for authorization, meaning the result is compatible
        with Authorization API service v2.

        If the consumer has connections to many groups/roles (with
        [join-groups](#operation--join-groups-post)) and they have many permissions,
        the permissions are concatenated in the following way:
        * allow permissions are combined with set union
        * deny permissions are combined with set intersection

        Hierarchical structure of the O-DF paths is taken into account when
        doing these set operations. This way the consumer, belonging to a
        certain group, can not lose any permissions in that group just by
        joining other groups.

      - in: "body"

      * `r` for read request
      * `w` for write request
      * `c` for call request
      * `d` for delete request

      When setting new permissions, many request types can be used by concatenating them.
